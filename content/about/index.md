My name is Noam Elfanbaum, and I live in Hulata, a beautiful spot in northern Israel, with my wife, two kids, and our dog.

My career journey has been shaped by a passion for Python and community-building. I have experience teaching Python classes, freelancing, and organizing vibrant Python community events like [PywebIL][pyweb] and [Pycon Israel][pycon]. Previously, I worked at Nvidia and Cisco, gaining valuable experience in the tech industry.

For the past eight years, I’ve been with Bluevine Inc., a leading banking platform for SMBs. I started as a consultant, progressed to team lead, and now serve as Director of Engineering. In my current role, I oversee the engineering team responsible for building and maintaining our core platform.

I enjoy writing about topics that captivate me, including Python, software engineering, and management. I hope you’ll find my insights engaging and valuable too.
