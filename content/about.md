I'm Noam Elfanbaum, I live in Tel-Aviv with my wife, baby-daughter and dog.
I used to teach Python classes, do freelance work and organize Python community gatherings ([PywebIL][pyweb] and [Pycon Israel][pycon]). These days I've settled on a serious day job as a engineering team lead a Bluevine. Hope you enjoy the blog posts!
