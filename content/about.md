I'm Noam Elfanbaum, I live in Tel-Aviv with my wife, baby-daughter and dog. In general, my life revolves around finding meaning and fulfilment, and in this blog, you'll get to read what I came up with, along with other, more specific interests that indirectly serves that goal.

Those interests include philosophy (mainly ethics), sports, meditation, politics, music and finally computers and software development, which is what I do for a living. Since I was young, computers and software fascinated me. I enjoy tinkering with my system, reading and implementing new ideas and taking part in the communities discussions.

I used to teach Python classes, do freelance work and organize Python community gatherings ([PywebIL][pyweb] and [Pycon Israel][pycon]). These days I've settled on a serious day job as a engneering team lead a Bluevine. If you're interested in any of the above, ping me at one of the links bellow. Hope you enjoy the blog posts!
