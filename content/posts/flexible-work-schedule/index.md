## Working as a programmer can be fun! But...

For many of us, programming is a hobby as well as a job. But, I can say that for most of my professional career, as much as I enjoy programming, I didn't really enjoy my work. There are a few reasons I can think of why is that, but the main one I believe is that mostly I had limited space for self-expression. Well, that makes sense since the majority of businesses are not focused on that, although it can provide a real edge for a company.

I have a lot to say about how a company/team can provide better space for self-expression to its employees, and I do hope to put all that in writing one bit a time, but here I'd like to focus on flexible work schedules. When we appreciate the fact that different people have different lifestyles and that the 9 to 5 workday isn't a good fit for all, we can encourage them to express this at work.

## My flexible work schedule

Working 8-9 straight hours is often ineffective for me. I get 3-4 hours of good concentration to do meaningful work, then another 2-3 to do tasks that require little to no concentration, and finally another 1-2 hours of dullness. For me staying a full workday in the office can many times feel ineffective and unpleasant. What I try to do is add an exercise session in between, or leave when my attention span is reaching zero, and pick up some work back at home when I feel more refreshed.

I used to struggle with this since allowing for unique schedule for individuals wasn't the norm in any of the places I worked. Now, I feel freer to peruse this type of work-life balance mostly since I take more meaningful part in setting the work norms. I wouldn't say though that I feel free to do whatever I want schedule wise, since appearances are important and I wouldn't like to be seen as a slacker or anything of that sort, so I try to balance it out. Sometimes I go out, sometimes I stay.

## Different people have different preferences

Members of my team also have very different lifestyles, one has hobbies he likes to peruse in the day time, and he needs to arrive late or to come early in order to do so and then he makes up for it by staying in late or working from home in the early morning. Another team member schedule resembles a swiss clock: always arriving and leaving at the same time. But he also prefers working a day from home every once so often. I try to encourage each team member to go and do his thing, but let him know that it is expected of him to put in the same number of hours as everyone.

## Why should time even be measured?

Since our team's success isn't measured by the number of hours put in, but by the impact we make: the features and support we provide are what help the company succeed, why should time be emphasized at all? I think it's mostly a matter of good old fairness. It will feel inappropriate if one team member would work 5 hours a day, even if he produced much more output in that time than the rest of the individuals in the team. Also, I can say that since the tempo of developing software is not linear - sometimes it goes faster and sometimes slower than expected - it's good to have another signal of the work being put in, which is time.

Since it's more difficult to measure impact made than hours worked, the first is slightly neglected while the latter is heavily focused on. That can be a reasonable tradeoff since simplicity is key for working systems, and measuring time is simpler. Sometimes though, a system can work much better by adding elements that increase it's complexity, and I argue this is the case here. I'd really like to see how remote companies go about impact measurement, they must have advanced ways to so since they are very limited in measuring hours.

## That trust thing

A serious issue that rises when allowing flexible schedules is trust. If someone goes home early and says he'll work from home later on, how can I tell that this will actually happen? I can't. Well, I can try to see if he pushes any commits or send out any emails but thats not very effective (or mature). I don't have a straight answer for this, but 2 things that can help are:

1. Gut feeling - sometimes you feel that something is off, and if this feeling stays, then it's a good time to have a chat about with that person.
2. General performance - if that person is seriously slacking off, his performance would probably show it as well. This is not an easy one, since it's hard measuring performance, but if the work is organized well, it would show, especially with comparison to other developers.

For me, it's important not to let resentment pile up and have the inconvenient conversation about it. This conversation doesn't have to be a finger pointing type of discussion. Once you let the person know you genuinely care for her work-life balance, but you sense that something is not working out with time obligations met - it can open up a place for understanding each other intentions better. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding or perhaps there is some truth in that, either way, it's possible to find a better way forward from that point: better communications, more actual time in the office, etc.

## Engaged developers are much more fun to work with!

I believe that team members who feel their schedule preferences are valued at their workplace, feel more accepted and are more likely to bring their full selves into work. This means that they are not just empty code monkeys but engaged developers who care deeply about what they do, and this makes a world of difference when coming to work every morning.
