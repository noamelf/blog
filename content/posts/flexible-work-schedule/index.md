Working as a programmer can be fun, for many of us, programming is a hobby as well as a job. But, I can say for myself that for most of my professional career, as much a I enjoy programming, I didn't really enjoy my work. There are few reasons I can think of why is that, but them main one I believe is that mostly I had a limited space for self expression. Well, that makes sense since the majority of businesses are not built with the mindset to provide places for self expression to their employees, it can however serve as means to an end of getting better performance from employees. 

There are many facets to how one can provide this, but I'd like to focus on flexible work schedules. A lot have been said about this topic as well, and I'd like to focus on the daily experience I have. First, I'll start with my preferences. I feel that working 8-9 straight hours is not effective for me. I get 3-4 hours of good concentration to do meaningful work, then another 2-3 to do tasks that require little to no concentration, and finally another 1-2 hours of dullness. Hence for me staying a full workday in the office can feel ineffective and cause burn out. What I try to do is add an exercise session in between, or leave when I feel not concentrated and pick up some work back at home when I feel more refreshed.

My kind of work-life balance can be said to be a mix - I never really fully disengage from work, which is something that is often criticized about modern connectivity, but on the other hand I use it to my advantage to split the work in to the times when I feel fit most. This has many advantages for me since in the essence I enjoy working, I just don't like doing it when I lack the mental energy for it. I used to struggle with this, since this approach wasn't something common in any of the places I used to work. Now, I feel more free to peruse this type of work-life balance mostly since I lead a team and can take a larger part in setting the work conventions, but still I feel obligated to the "old school" of spending the full workday in the office, so I try to balance it out. Sometimes I go out, sometimes I stay.

The members of my team also have very different lifestyles, one has hobbies he like to peruse in the day time, and he needs to arrive late or to come early in order to do so. Another, is like a swiss clock, always arriving and leaving on the same time, and the last one goes to the gym in the mornings or evenings, so he fits his day to work to this schedule. I try to encourage each team member to go and do his thing, but remember he needs to see that on the total he is putting in the amount of hours that are agreed upon. 

This is also a question though, since our team's success isn't dependent upon the amount of hours put in, but upon the impact we make. The amount and quality of features we manage to deliver is in fact what is providing value for the company. So why do I emphasize time? I think that since the tempo of developing software is not linear - meaning sometimes it goes faster and sometimes slower then expected, it's good to have another signal of the work being put in, which is time. In pure rational, it seems a little funny, but it is a practical measure to make sure everyone is taking their share of the load.

I think since it's much more difficult to measure impact made than hours worked, one is neglected while the other is enforced in a lot of organizations. But putting into account the tremendous benefits of having people set flexible schedules that fits their lifestyles, makes it a no-brainier to prefer it. I can really see the impact it makes on my burnout rate and on my team members satisfaction.
