Working as a programmer can be fun! For many of us, programming is a hobby as well as a job. But, I can say that for most of my professional career, as much as I enjoy programming, I didn't really enjoy my work. There are a few reasons I can think of why is that, but the main one I believe is that mostly I had limited space for self-expression. Well, that makes sense since the majority of businesses are not built with that mindset - to encourage self-expression - it is however well know that happy employees produce better work, and that's something that each manager and company is looking to achieve. 

I have a lot to say about how a company/team can provide space for self expression to it's employees and I hope to put all that in writing slowly, but here I'd like to focus on flexible work schedules. When we appreciate the fact that different people have different lifestyles and that the 9 to 5 workday isn't a good fit for all, we can encourage them to express this at work. 

Leading a development team, I'm in a position to have some influence over that for my team members that I'll try to share here. First, I'll start with my preferences: working 8-9 straight hours is often not effective for me. I get 3-4 hours of good concentration to do meaningful work, then another 2-3 to do tasks that require little to no concentration, and finally another 1-2 hours of dullness. For me staying a full workday in the office can many times feel ineffective and unpleasant. What I try to do is add an exercise session in between, or leave when I feel not concentrated and pick up some work back at home when I feel more refreshed.

Going home and opening the laptop at night again can be seen as an out of sync work-life balance in the sense that I never really fully disengage from work, but on the other hand, I like it since I can split work to the times slots when I feel most productive. In the essence I enjoy working, I just don't like doing it when I lack the mental energy for it. I used to struggle with this since this approach wasn't something common in any of the places I worked at. Now, I feel freer to peruse this type of work-life balance mostly since I take more meaningful part in setting the work norms. I wouldn't say though that I feel free to do whatever fits my day since I still feel the need to fit into the "full workday in the office" norm, even if it's just so that I won't stand out in an awkward light in that regard, so I try to balance it out. Sometimes I go out, sometimes I stay.

The members of my team also have very different lifestyles, one has hobbies he likes to peruse in the day time, and he needs to arrive late or to come early in order to do so and then he makes up for it by staying in late or working from home in the early morning. Another, is like a swiss clock, always arriving and leaving at the same time, but likes to work a day from home every week. The last one goes to the gym in the mornings or evenings, so he fits his day to work on this schedule. I encourage each team member to go and do his thing, but let him know that it is expected of him to put in the same number of hours as "everyone".

This raises a question since our team's success isn't measured by number of hours put in, but by the impact we make: the features and support we provide is what help the company succeed. So why should time be emphasized at all? I think it's mostly a matter of good old fairness. It will feel in appropriate if one team member would work 5 hours a day, even if he produced much more output in that time than the rest of the individuals in the team/company. Also, I can say that since the tempo of developing software is not linear - meaning sometimes it goes faster and sometimes slower than expected, it's good to have another signal of the work being put in, which is time. In pure rational, it seems a little funny, but it is a practical measure to make sure everyone is taking their share of the load. A more liberal approach would be to not emphasize time at all, and I think that what actually happens in many "remote first" companies, but I'm not free to make this call where I work, so I don't ponder it too much.

A serious question that raises in allowing flexible schedules is trust. We'll if someone goes home early and says he will work from home later on, how can I tell that he is actually keeping his word. I'm not sure that this is something that can ever be fully resolved, meaning, I can't really be sure that this individual is putting in the time as same as he would have been if he obligated to work from the office. I think that this is something that could be sensed and discussed openly:  as a manager you kind of feel if someone is continuously slacking off, when he say he would pick up the work later on. This hunch doesn't have to become resentment hiding away in the back of your head, but it can become a topic for an open conversation. If you can make it clear that that person work-life balance is very important for you, but you feel that something is not working out in the sense of obligations met - my experience shows that the employee will show respect for that either try to show you that that's not the case and you can workout a system together to increase your confidence in that, or that there is some truth in that and she'll try to improve.

I think since it's much more difficult to measure impact made than hours worked, the first is neglected while the latter is enforced in many organizations. Putting into account the tremendous benefits of having people set flexible schedules that fit their lifestyles, makes it a no-brainer to prefer it. I can really see the impact it makes on my burnout rate and on my team members' satisfaction.
