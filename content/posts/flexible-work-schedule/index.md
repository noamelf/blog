Working as a programmer can be fun! For many of us, programming is a hobby as well as a job. But, I can say that for most of my professional career, as much as I enjoy programming, I didn't really enjoy my work. There are a few reasons I can think of why is that, but the main one I believe is that mostly I had limited space for self-expression. Well, that makes sense since the majority of businesses are not built with that mindset - to provide places for self-expression to their employees - it is however well know that happy employees produce better work, and that's something that each manager and company is looking to achieve. 

I have a lot to say about how a company/team can provide space for self expression to it's employees and I hope to put that in writing one day, but here I'd like to focus on encouraging flexible work schedules. When we appreciate the fact that different people have different lifestyles and that the 9 to 5 workday isn't a good fit for all, we can encourage, instead of deny them to express this at work. 

In this post I'll try to share daily experience as a team lead with flexible work schedules. First, I'll start with my preferences: working 8-9 straight hours is not effective for me. I get 3-4 hours of good concentration to do meaningful work, then another 2-3 to do tasks that require little to no concentration, and finally another 1-2 hours of dullness. Hence, for me staying a full workday in the office can feel ineffective and cause burnout. What I try to do is add an exercise session in between, or leave when I feel not concentrated and pick up some work back at home when I feel more refreshed.

This kind of work-life balance can be criticized in the sense that I never really fully disengage from work, but on the other hand, I like it since I can split the work to the times when I feel productive. In the essence I enjoy working, I just don't like doing it when I lack the mental energy for it. I used to struggle with this since this approach wasn't something common in any of the places I worked at. Now, I feel freer to peruse this type of work-life balance mostly since I lead a team and can take a larger part in setting the work conventions, but still, I feel obligated to the "old school" of spending the full workday in the office, so I try to balance it out. Sometimes I go out, sometimes I stay.

The members of my team also have very different lifestyles, one has hobbies he likes to peruse in the day time, and he needs to arrive late or to come early in order to do so and he makes up for it by staying in late or working from home in the early morning. Another, is like a swiss clock, always arriving and leaving at the same time, but likes to work a day from home every week. The last one goes to the gym in the mornings or evenings, so he fits his day to work on this schedule. I encourage each team member to go and do his thing, but let him know that it is expected of him to put in the same number of hours as "everyone".

This raises a question since our team's success isn't measured by number of hours put in, but by the impact we make: the features and support we provide is what help the company succeed. So why should time be time emphasized at all? I think that since the tempo of developing software is not linear - meaning sometimes it goes faster and sometimes slower than expected, it's good to have another signal of the work being put in, which is time. In pure rational, it seems a little funny, but it is a practical measure to make sure everyone is taking their share of the load. A more liberal approach would be to not emphasize time at all, and I think that what actually happens in many "remote first" companies, but I'm not free to make this call where I work, so I don't ponder it too much.

Trust is not 

I think since it's much more difficult to measure impact made than hours worked, the first is neglected while the latter is enforced in many organizations. Putting into account the tremendous benefits of having people set flexible schedules that fit their lifestyles, makes it a no-brainer to prefer it. I can really see the impact it makes on my burnout rate and on my team members' satisfaction.
