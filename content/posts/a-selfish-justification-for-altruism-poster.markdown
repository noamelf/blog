title: A selfish justification for altruism (poster)
---

Next week I'm presenting a philosophy paper I wrote about altruism (see [previous post](https://thespoon.ghost.io/a-selfish-justification-for-altruism-2)) in a conference at Tel-Hai college!  

Alexandra, my girlfriend, came up with the idea (and executed it on Photoshop). The triangle represent the main 3 concepts in the paper: altruism, autonomy and well-being. Through those triangles (concepts) the image (life) looks sharper. I'd Love to hear you're opinion on it.
