title: Teaching Python to Haredim (and a CNN visit)
---

For the last couple of months I've been involved in a great project: getting [Haredic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism) (ultra-orthodox jews) man into the software world! 

Last week, we got an exciting visit from Oren Libermann, a CNN reporter, who published this nice [story](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/08/world/israel-ultra-orthodox-jews-high-tech/index.html#).

My job in the training process is to teach them the Python programing language. Were doing a 3 month course, in which we go from learning the basic features of the language to writing a full blown (but small) software project.

The last mini-project we did might give an short example of what the course entails: the students we're given a CSV file, with some basic data about the world's countries. They needed to analyze that data and create a website which they published later using Github pages. Here is a sample of the results: [1](http://www.elnatan.890m.com/), [2](http://spidivardi.github.io/contrys/new.html), [3](http://moshefortgang.github.io/mosho-fortgang-world.site.net/).

Theres much more to write and I'll try to update as the course advances!
